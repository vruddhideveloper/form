APAC Region:
Successfully executed Stress Testing 2024 for pre-trade controls (SOQ, SOV, GMV, PT, RL, RegK) by analyzing 7-month historical data, determining peak volumes, and completing all testing milestones with thorough documentation
Implemented and supported new restricted codes (1-AC, 1-PT, 1-SH, 1-MP, 1-MS) in Agency and Principal Flows
Developed and deployed self-service tool supporting admin and request-response details across all APAC instances
Automated testplan for China EO Phase 2, enabling comprehensive testing of exemption configurations and rules

EMEA Region:

Completed Stress Testing 2024 for GMOC Control Flow through systematic volume analysis and testing
Enhanced OPO/OCO checks integration in daily overrides and rejects reports
Enforced restriction codes (1-GC, 1-TH, 1-LL, 1-JS) for Principal and PT SWAP Flow
TCI Decom: Automated the Performance Testing (deployed in Prod Parallel) 
TCI Decom: Enhanced D1/Basket Flow capabilities
Consolidated CIT ref data JDLs by establishing distinct JDLs for Spark and CIT Ref Data
Added restricted list support for Rights and Warrants

JISU Options:
Contributed to Options JDL Performance POC by:
Designed and implemented Python-based interactive Web Dashboard for Options JDL performance stats,latency breakdowns, and daily performance trends. It also displays interactive graphs and histograms to analyze performance better.

CIT:
Enhanced latency script to break down further to view on granular level latencies for better observations.

=================================

APAC Region:

Executed comprehensive stress testing for pre-trade controls including SOQ, SOV, GMV, PT, RL, and RegK by retrieving 7-month historical logs, determining peak volumes, and conducting multiple testing rounds with QA validation
Collaborated extensively with NA PM Team, Exbcore Team, and Program managers to gather and implement stress testing requirements
Automated the stress testing process through:

Deploying server jobs for daily trade volume and statistics collection
Eliminating manual log downloads from PM hosts
Developing automated order pumping and report generation capabilities


Supported implementation of new restricted codes (1-AC, 1-PT, 1-SH, 1-MP, 1-MS) across Agency and Principal Flows
Developed and deployed self-service tool facilitating admin and request-response management for all APAC instances
China EO Phase 2: 
Automated the testplan for testing exemption Config and check incoming orders against the allowed rules(combination of desk, Instruments, BLE)

Wrote end-to-end testcases through testplan automation and carried out postiive and negative testing


EMEA Region:

Conducted GMOC Control Flow stress testing through systematic volume analysis and execution
Enhanced daily overrides and rejects reports by incorporating OPO/OCO check data from OMS systems
Implemented restriction codes (1-GC, 1-TH, 1-LL, 1-JS) for Principal and PT SWAP Flow
For TCI Decom project:

Automated performance testing for Stride Trading
Developed process for pumping individual and basket orders using web services and injector tools
Captured and compared LC performance against TCI latency


Consolidated CIT ref data JDLs by establishing distinct JDLs for Spark and CIT Ref Data
Implemented restricted list support for Rights and Warrants


Jisu Options:

JDL Performance POC:
